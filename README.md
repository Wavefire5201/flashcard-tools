# flashcard tools

currently, this tool scrapes the
[joshu](https://laits.utexas.edu/japanese/joshu/index.php)
website for the vocab list and turns them into anki flashcards. I plan to add
quizlet format support soon, and maybe turn this into a general flashcard
generator for many different data types.

### how to use

clone and use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```bash
uv sync
uv run main.py
```
